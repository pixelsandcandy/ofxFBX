### Blender workflow. 
Using Blender 2.63, the FBX exporter is not fully featured and there are known bugs that may be fixed in the future.
Apply any transformations before exporting using ctrl + A. http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Fade/Doc:2.6/Manual/3D_interaction/Transform_Control/Reset_Object_Transformations

When exporting, be sure to set the **_Forward_** to **_Y Forward_** and the **_Up_** to **_Z Up_**.
